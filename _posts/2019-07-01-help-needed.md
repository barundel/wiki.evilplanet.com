We have recovered what we can from backups and are working on building a new site and forum, unfortunately, there was some data loss in the form of mods. The first part of EvilPlanet we are actively working on rebuilding is the Wiki, if you know Markdown and are interesting in helping or have some EvilGenius mods on your hard-drive then, please <b><a href="mailto:webmaster@evilplanet.com" title="contact us">contact us</a>

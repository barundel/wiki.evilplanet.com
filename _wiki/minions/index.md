## About
You may not like it, but you rely on minions as much as they rely on you! There are many types of minions, each with different purposes. The sections below will describe the tasks of minions in general. Click on any minion in the list (http://95.215.225.23/~evilplan/wiki/index.php?title=Minions#Types) below to get details on them.

## Controlling minions

Unlike Evil Geniuses (http://95.215.225.23/~evilplan/wiki/index.php?title=Evil_Geniuses) and Henchmen (http://95.215.225.23/~evilplan/wiki/index.php?title=Henchmen) minions cannot be directly controlled by the player. Nonetheless there are some indirect ways to manage them.

Henchmen can use their special "gather minions" ability to guide the nearby minions into a certain area of the base or island.
Through the use of timeclocks (http://95.215.225.23/~evilplan/wiki/index.php?title=Timeclock) the player can manage the staffing level of certain rooms.
The Evil Genius can prioritize construction tasks by pointing at them
Door security levels (http://95.215.225.23/~evilplan/wiki/index.php?title=Door) can allow or not allow minions into certain areas of the base
The Minion Management Screen (http://95.215.225.23/~evilplan/wiki/index.php?title=Minion_Management_Screen) allows the player to set the desired quantities of each minion type up to the maximum minion capacity level.
On the World Domination Screen (http://95.215.225.23/~evilplan/wiki/index.php?title=World_Domination_Screen) minions can be ordered to leave the island in order to perform evil deeds in the wider world

### Staffing rooms with timeclocks
In order to help with minion control, use timeclocks to regulate how many minions there should be working in the room. If the timeclock is set to red, the room shuts down and no power goes to it.When the clock is set to yellow minions will work in the room whenever they have time and feel like it. Once the timeclock is set at max, all of your minions will work at the room as often they can and if the room is filled with working minions your minions will wait until their turn and sometimes even make lines for working.

## Tasks on the island

### Room construction and demolition
Main article: Rooms (http://95.215.225.23/~evilplan/wiki/index.php?title=Rooms)

Construction workers are the sole minion capable constructing a new room or demolishing an old one.

### lacing, moving and destroying items
Main article: Items (http://95.215.225.23/~evilplan/wiki/index.php?title=Items)

Only Construction workers and valets can grab a briefcase from the strongroom, bring it to the depot, buy an object crate, and bring the object to its correct place, but all minions can re-package objects and move them somewhere else. Every minion also carries "Space Warping Boxes" which they will use to dutifully pick up objects and crumple them into nothingness, at full refund for the object's price, regardless of the object's condition.

### Repairing damaged base items
Technicians will walk around your base fixing whatever needs to be fixed. Always make sure you have plenty of them and that they have access to damaged items or your base will fall apart around you!

### Extinguishing fires
This is a job for the valet. To extinguish fires you need to have a fire extinguisher nearby so valets can run to them and put the fire(s) out. It is a good idea to place fire extinguishers near objects in the base that are likely to catch fire or very expensive.

Note: Fire Extinguisher can only be placed in corridors.

Note: Due to poor AI code for handling fires you are better off having only a few extinguishers. When a fire occurs a Valet that can acquire an extinguisher will 'tag' the fire for itself. This means in a room full of flames each fire will be tagged by a different Valet and so the first one there will only put out one fire before returning to other duties, the other fires will remain, possibly spreading while other Valets arrive. Limiting yourself to a few well placed extinguishers means more often than not the fire Valet there will put out most of the fire by the time any others arrive.

### Taking care of exhausted minions
This is a job for social minions. When another minion can no longer work (example: collapses from lack of endurance, dumbfounded by lack of smarts or if a henchman's health drops to zero), a social minion (usually a valet) comes and picks him up and carries him off to recuperate (e.g. to the barracks to rest or to the archives to study).

### Performing research
Main article: Research

Research is performed by science minions (technicians, scientists, biochemists, and quantum physicists) and helps you by unlocking more advanced items like new traps, higher security doors and better surveillance systems.

### Defending the base
All minions recruited to an Evil Lair never lose their 10 second self-defense training, allowing them to look away from their aggressor and pitifully punch them back, if they are ever attacked and live long enough to respond.

In order to defend the whole base, however, you will need the aid of henchmen, traps and military minions (guards, mercenaries, marksmen and martial artists). Social minions (valets, spindoctors, playboys and diplomats) also play a key role in base security by distracting and confusing agents.

Construction workers can make weak attempts to kill or capture agents, but building a security network and creating mobs of them can be devastating to the Forces of Justice, even Super Agents. Construction workers, just like guards and mercenaries, are more efficient at fighting when carrying weapons.

Details About The Game
----------------------

**Evil Genius**'

**[Minion Types](http://wiki.n1nj4.com/index.php/List_of_Minion_Types)**

**Missions**

**Henchmen**

The above should be made into links to their pages, which I would do
myself, if I knew how to make a page, then link it here....

EDIT: Got the link to work now. Apparently, you only need one set of
brackets, and a space between the URL and the link title. Just by guess,
seems you make the link first, then click on it to make the page.

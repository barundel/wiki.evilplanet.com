Details About The Game
----------------------

**Evil Genius**'

**[Minion Types](http://wiki.n1nj4.com/index.php/List_of_Minion_Types)**

**Missions**

**Henchmen**

**Agents**

The above should be made into links to their pages, which I would do
myself, if I knew how to make a page, then link it here....

EDIT: Got the link to work now. Apparently, you only need one set of
brackets, and a space between the URL and the link title.

Note: From looking at Jon's post, to make a page, make a link to it
here, the URL being

'''ht tp://wiki.n1nj4.com/index.php?title=(Title of the page, spaces
replaced by an \_ )&action=edit '''.

Of course, remove the quotation marks, unnessesary space that I added to
prevent it from being a link, and parentheses. Then click the link and
make it.

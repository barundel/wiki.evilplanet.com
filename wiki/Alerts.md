If the [Forces of Justice](/wiki/Forces_of_Justice "wikilink") are being
especially troublesome you can always put your base on alert. There are
three main types of alert:

Green Alert
-----------

If your base is set to Green Alert your minions will disarm themselves
and behave normally. Use green alert during periods of low
[heat](/wiki/Heat "wikilink"). Green Alert is what the game automatically sets
the alert level to unless you change it. The alert level should always
be on green unless you're under attack by enemies that are not easily
dispatched.

Yellow Alert
------------

If your base is set to Yellow Alert, minions will go to the
[Armoury](/wiki/Armoury "wikilink") to arm themselves. Yellow alert is most
commonly used if there are potentially dangerous
[agents](/wiki/Agents "wikilink") on the island.

Red Alert
---------

If you set your base to Red Alert your minions will arm themselves and
run around the island, attacking any and all [agents](/wiki/Agents "wikilink")
they encounter. This should be used in emergencies or when your base is
under attack by a troublesome group of soldiers.

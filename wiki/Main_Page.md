Welcome to our Evil Planet Wiki!

A few notes
-----------

We hope you enjoy our site. As you may know, wiki-sites are at their
best when everyone pitches in to create a great resource. Play nicely
and this'll be a great resource for Evil Genius fans.

### Testing

Please use your personal user pages and their talk pages to practise
using wiki code. You'll need to sign up before you can do this.

### Site Organisation

I am aware that this site will naturally evolve but it will be useful
for get all pages that are created in some sort of order so they
maintain the same look and feel, and are easy to navigate. For example,
it would be good to have the page for [Valets](/wiki/Valets "wikilink") to be
similar to the one for [Construction
Workers](/wiki/Construction_Workers "wikilink") in layout. These would then be
indexed in a page such as [List of Minion
Types](/wiki/List_of_Minion_Types "wikilink").

It would be good if some members could concentrate on getting this
organisation sorted, and others can specialise in the content.

### Text and Images

Due to the closure of Elixir Studios and the precedent set by [Evil
Planet](http://www.evilplanet.com), we shouldn't have any problems using
most of the images and text we would want. Feel free to use images and
text from Evil Planet, although it would be good to update and adapt
this as required.

### Standards

This site isn't Wikipedia, but it doesn't mean that we can't have at
reasonable level of standards. Please write in full sentences and use
proper punctuation! Don't also forget that Elixir Studios and Evil
Genius are British, so it's perfectly acceptable to use both British
English and American English spelling.

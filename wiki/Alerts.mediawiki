If the [[Forces of Justice]] are being especially troublesome you can always put your base on alert. There are three main types of alert:

==Green Alert==

If your base is set to Green Alert your minions will disarm themselves and behave normally. Use green alert during periods of low [[Heat|heat]]. Green Alert is what the game automatically sets the alert level to unless you change it. The alert level should always be on green unless you're under attack by enemies that are not easily dispatched.

==Yellow Alert==

If your base is set to Yellow Alert, minions will go to the [[Armoury]] to arm themselves. Yellow alert is most commonly used if there are potentially dangerous [[Agents|agents]] on the island.

==Red Alert==

If you set your base to Red Alert your minions will arm themselves and run around the island, attacking any and all [[Agents|agents]] they encounter. This should be used in emergencies or when your base is under attack by a troublesome group of soldiers.
